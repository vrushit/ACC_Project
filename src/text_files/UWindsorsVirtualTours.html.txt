The International Students Centre (ISC) helped ease the transition when coming to the University of Windsor. The ISC often hosts events for international students to get acquainted, share their experiences and learn about Canadian culture. Staying in residence was also helpful with the transition to Canada. I was able to connect with other students and get familiar with the campus. I even worked for residence services. This enhanced my communication skills and allowed me to gain some valuable work experience. Chelsea Okonji Lagos, Nigeria I have taken advantage of the services available at the Student Success Centre by booking monthly appointments with my Academic Advisors. These appointments allowed me to speak about my schedule, courses, and time management strategy. Having someone to follow up with my progress was helpful because I improved my skills through the resources provided. This is one of the many UWindsor services that helped me enhance in my academic experience. Zeenat Hirani Kinshasa, Congo My University of Windsor experience has been exceptional. The teaching is incredible with amazing engineering facilities and superior support from faculty members. Whether for a final year project or a simple question in the class, a faculty member will always be there to help. The University of Windsor campus is so vibrant that I never feel like I'm far away from home. Aditya Vyas Vadodara, India I believe that the University of Windsor prepared me for entering the workforce and I credit the renowned co-op program for giving me the skills and experience to succeed in a post-graduate world. My advice to incoming international students is to make meaningful connections (both personal and professional) whether it be through co-op or joining clubs on campus, and take advantage of all the resources the University has to offer as they will set you up for success in the future. Jai Priyadarshi Delhi, India I came to the University of Windsor to obtain my Master of Engineering degree. I gained the necessary industry skills and knowledge from the courses that helped me excel in my current field of work. The resources that helped me succeed in my university career are the International Student Centre (ISC) and Career Development Services (CDEL), as they assisted with work permits, Visa's and strengthening my resume and cover letter. My advice to incoming international students is to gain as much work experience in Canada as possible and to utilize UWindsor's on-campus resources to succeed. Zachary Zhang Beijing, China When I was deciding where to study in Canada it was clear that studying at the University of Windsor would be one of the best decisions I would ever make. I learned so much and grew in many ways and I look forward to giving back to my community. I participated in the Ignite Work Study program where I worked at the International Student Centre. This gave me insight into a lot of resources available at the University. I also used the career advising resources at the Odette School of Business, where I was given the tools to succeed in the Canadian workplace. My advice is to ensure your resume and cover letter are well written and meet the Canadian standard and gain Canadian work-related experience by volunteering in any capacity.
