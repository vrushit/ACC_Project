New recreation complex dubbed the Toldo Lancer Centre Mar 30th, 2022 The University of Windsor will name its new sports and recreation complex the Toldo Lancer Centre, officials announced Tuesday outside the complex?s main doors. The centre is being named after the late entrepreneur and philanthropist Anthony P. Toldo, who supported many local causes, focusing primarily on health services. To continue his legacy of philanthropy, he established the Toldo Foundation in 1996. After Toldo died in 2009, his son Anthony G. (Tony) Toldo took the helm of the foundation. ?Making an impact in the areas of health and wellness has been a priority for our family for generations,? said Tony Toldo. ?We are confident the Toldo Lancer Centre will be a central hub for fitness and recreation activities for the campus and Windsor-Essex communities.? This is the latest contribution of the Toldo Foundation to the University of Windsor. The foundation?s support helped realize the construction of the Anthony P. Toldo Health Education and Learning Centre, home to the Faculty of Nursing. The Toldo Foundation funds scholarships, ground-breaking research, and learning spaces at the University, enhancing experiences and expanding opportunities for students, staff, and faculty. The Toldo Lancer Centre is a ?state-of-the-art, accessible facility featuring a triple gymnasium with seating for 2,000 spectators; an eight-lane, 25-metre pool; a recreational walking and running track; a fitness centre; and multi-purpose rooms. Open to all, this community hub will help improve the health of residents in the region. Set to open this fall, the $73 million complex will be able to host international, national, and provincial games and championships as well as large-scale events, conferences, and more. ?The Toldo Lancer Centre is a bold and ambitious project with immense potential benefits for our campus communities and for Windsor-Essex. We are thrilled to be working in partnership to create this important focal point, which will bring communities together and to enhance health and wellness across the region,? said UWindsor president Robert Gordon. ?We believe this project will truly build our campus, build community, and build champions.? He noted the University has a deep and long-standing relationship with the Toldo family. ?We are truly grateful for the leadership, vision, and generosity they have shown,? Dr. Gordon said. ?Their efforts continue to be an inspiration to all of us.? The Toldo family has been a leader in industry, philanthropy, and community service in the Windsor area for approximately 70 years. In addition to the foundation?s support of medical education at the University of Windsor, it has made significant contributions to the Hospice of Windsor and Essex County, the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre, and the Windsor Symphony Orchestra. Linda Rohr, dean of the Faculty of Human Kinetics, expressed her deepest thanks to the Toldo family. ?This incredible gift to the University of Windsor is creating a legacy that will benefit our students and community for generations to come,? Dr. Rohr said. ?The Toldo family?s generosity is making a positive and remarkable difference to our students, residents, and visitors.?
