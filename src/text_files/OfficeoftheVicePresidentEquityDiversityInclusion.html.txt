The University of Windsor is addressing it. The university has taken an important step in this regard, by establishing an executive leadership position in Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) by appointing an Interim Vice President. It is a recognition that as an institution, we have more work to do in creating a more inclusive and just campus. It is also a commitment to taking concrete steps to be better. Representation of diversity at the executive leadership table is an important and overdue piece of the bigger picture for the university. Read more of Dr. Beckford's Statement Equity Is fundamentally about fairness. We will work to ensure fair treatment, equitable access to opportunities and equitable treatment under our policies and procedures. Diversity Is about the representation of difference. We are concerned with who is at the table and if the difference is accounted for. We will foster an environment in which differences are valued. Inclusion Is about belonging. Do we all feel that we are a valued and respected part of the organization? We will foster an environment where everyone has a say. Justice A just campus is a safe and secure place for all, with special attention to the powerless and most marginalized and disadvantaged. This requires an environment where policies and procedures are applied consistently and fairly.
